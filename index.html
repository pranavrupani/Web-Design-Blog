    <h2>Current state of affairs of Chelsea Football Club</h2>
      <p>Chelsea Football Club, based in London, is one of the most successful football clubs in England. They are known as one of the big six clubs in the Premier League. Chelsea has won numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple Premier League titles, FA Cups, and the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>In recent years, Chelsea has undergone significant changes, including a change in ownership. The club was acquired by a consortium led by Todd Boehly in 2022 after the previous owner, Roman Abramovich, was forced to sell the club due to sanctions imposed on him by the UK government. On paper this seemed like a great opportunity and ever since its acquisition,Boehly has invested billions into the club, which initially seemed like a declaration of intent for the club and its desires to win it all. However the current state of the club is less of a football team and more of an investment portfolio.</p>
      <p>Despite having a squad filled with potential world-class talent, the team has struggled to find consistency on the pitch. They boast a squad of 45 players + numerous loans, the club is over reliant on Cole Palmer and maybe Moises Caicedo. 90% of the club consists of Youth Wonderkids bought in the last 5 years, however the constant squad switching does not give the players the chance to sync as a team. On their own many of these players have immense talent, but they come from environments where often the club was built around them. Here at Chelsea, everyone is a star but no one is willing to play the supporting role.</p>
      <p>Looking at the current state of affairs, Chelsea currently sits 8th in the Premier League points table despite being predicted to be in the top 3, providing a tough challenge for the title contenders. However their last few fixtures have resulted in a draw and 2 losses, against subpar teams. In the champions league they barely clutched a win against Benfica, who on paper is much weaker than them, and got destroyed by Byern Munich. After the club world cup, everyone expected Chelsea to be a force to be reckoned with this season, however they have gone back to their old ways and deserve the nickname "The Blue Billion Dollar Bottle Jobs."</p>
      <p>As a passionate Chelsea fan, I truly believe in the clubs potential, but that can only be actualised if the club starts taking the sport seriously rather than gambling on wonderkids. All that money will be much better spent in bringing in a few superstars and key supporting players. We already have Caicedo and Palmer, build the team around them, don't shift focus to the next shiny new player who played 5 good games. No matter how generational the talent, unless the environment is suitable, their growth will be stunted, we all saw what happened to Ansu Fati. If I were the owner I would do a massive club clearout and start from scratch. That is one of the only ways this club can get back to it's glory.</p>
